                  A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage,
                  email, or feature to determine which one performs better based on user behavior. In this process,
                  users are randomly shown either version A (the control) or version B (the variation), and their
                  interactions—such as clicks, <br />
                  conversions, or engagement—are measured. By analyzing the data collected, teams can <br />
                  identify which version drives better results and make informed decisions to optimize user experience,
                  boost performance, and achieve business goals more effectively.
